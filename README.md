# Supervised Machine Learning
## Classification: Ticket summaries into categories


The deployed web app is live at https://summary-classifier.herokuapp.com/

This web app predicts the categories of a summary, between 20 possibilities of category. It is based on a Natural Language Processing and a Machine Learning model
(Logistic Regression, 89% accuracy)

As part of this, for each prediction you will see the explainability of it, using Lime and eli5 libraries.

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pickle
* eli5
* nltk
* lime
